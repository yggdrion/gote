# Go Migration Cleanup

This document summarizes the cleanup of Go-related files after migrating to TypeScript/Bun.

## Removed Files

### Go Source Code

- `main.go` - Original Go application (916 lines)
- `go.mod` - Go module definition
- `go.sum` - Go module checksums

### Build Artifacts

- `bin/` directory - Go compiled binaries
  - `bin/meemo` - Linux/macOS binary
  - `bin/meemo.exe` - Windows binary
- `Makefile` - Go build configuration (replaced with Bun version)

### Duplicate Files

- `Makefile.ts` - Duplicate TypeScript Makefile (kept `Makefile.bun` as `Makefile`)

## Updated Documentation

### README.md

- Changed title from "Meemo - Go Note-Taking App" to "Gote - TypeScript Note-Taking App"
- Updated feature descriptions to reflect encryption and TypeScript architecture
- Replaced Go setup instructions with Bun/TypeScript instructions
- Updated project structure section
- Modified API documentation to reflect authentication requirements
- Added security and encryption details
- Updated development and deployment instructions

### docs/VENDOR.md

- Updated references from "Go note-taking application" to "TypeScript/Bun note-taking application"
- Changed "npm scripts" references to "Bun scripts"

## Migration Benefits

The TypeScript/Bun version provides:

✅ **Full feature parity** with the Go version
✅ **Enhanced security** with AES-256-GCM encryption
✅ **Better developer experience** with TypeScript and hot reload
✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing encrypted data
✅ **Modern tooling** with Bun runtime
✅ **Cleaner architecture** with modular TypeScript design

## Current Status

- ✅ All Go files removed
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ TypeScript version fully functional
- ✅ No breaking changes to user data
- ✅ All features working (authentication, encryption, notes, search, settings)

The migration is complete and the repository is now clean of Go-related artifacts.
