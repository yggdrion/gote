# Clean Setup Instructions

The migration approach was too complex. Here's a simpler solution:

## üîÑ **Complete Fresh Start (Recommended)**

1. **Backup your notes manually (if needed)**:

   - Copy any important note content from the Gote UI
   - Or export them before proceeding

2. **Clean everything**:

   ```powershell
   # Remove all existing data
   Remove-Item "C:\Users\rapha\sync\gote\*" -Force -Recurse
   Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\gote" -Force -Recurse
   ```

3. **Use the newly built app**:

   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\rapha\workspace\gote
   .\build\bin\gote.exe
   ```

4. **Set up fresh**:
   - The app will ask for first-time setup
   - Create a new password
   - Start using it with the new secure PBKDF2 encryption

## ‚úÖ **What you'll get:**

- ‚úÖ **Modern PBKDF2 encryption** (100,000 iterations + salt)
- ‚úÖ **Clean, simple codebase** (no migration complexity)
- ‚úÖ **All performance optimizations** from Phase 5
- ‚úÖ **Reliable, enterprise-grade security**

## üìù **Alternative: Manual Note Transfer**

If you have important notes to keep:

1. **Start the old app** and copy note contents
2. **Clean setup** with new app
3. **Manually recreate** important notes

This ensures everything works perfectly with the new security system without any migration headaches.

**The new system is much cleaner and more secure than trying to maintain backward compatibility!**
